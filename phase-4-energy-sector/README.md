# Phase 4: Energy Sector Specialization

## Overview

This phase focuses specifically on energy sector and power grid cybersecurity. The emphasis is on understanding electricity infrastructure, regulatory compliance (NERC-CIP), energy-specific protocols, and the threat landscape targeting utilities and grid operations.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand power grid architecture (generation, transmission, distribution)
- Learn energy-specific protocols (IEC-61850, DNP3 in utility context)
- Study NERC-CIP compliance requirements
- Analyze threat actors targeting energy sector
- Build advanced detection capabilities for time-based and statistical anomalies
- Create energy sector security assessment and policy documentation

## Projects

### 01 - Power Grid Process Simulation
Building a power plant auxiliary system simulation (cooling water, pumps, temperature control) with realistic operational logic.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 02 - Advanced Detection Engineering
Implementing time-based anomaly detection, statistical baselines, and behavioral analysis for OT environments.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 03 - ICS SOC Playbooks
Developing operational playbooks for ICS-specific security incidents with triage, investigation, and response procedures.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 04 - NERC-CIP Policy Development
Drafting compliance-aligned security policies including patch management, ESP management, and security monitoring.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 05 - Threat Intelligence Analysis
Analyzing energy sector threat actors (XENOTIME, Sandworm, ELECTRUM) and their tactics, techniques, and procedures.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 06 - Capstone: Utility Security Assessment
Comprehensive security assessment report for a fictional utility company including gap analysis, recommendations, and implementation roadmap.

**Status:** Coming soon

## Tools Used

- **Simulation:** OpenPLC, ScadaBR, GridLAB-D (optional)
- **Detection:** Splunk advanced queries, Python ML scripts
- **Analysis:** Threat intelligence platforms, MITRE ATT&CK for ICS
- **Documentation:** Professional assessment and policy templates

## Energy Sector Focus Areas
