# Phase 3: ICS/OT Attack, Detection, & Monitoring

## Overview

This phase focuses on executing controlled attacks against industrial control systems in a safe lab environment and building comprehensive detection and response capabilities. The goal is to demonstrate full purple team competency in OT/ICS environments.

## Learning Objectives

- Execute safe ICS attack scenarios (replay, spoofing, unauthorized writes)
- Build multi-layer detection (network, SIEM, correlation)
- Analyze real-world ICS adversary campaigns
- Develop ICS-specific incident response procedures
- Produce professional-grade security documentation
- Understand safety implications of ICS attacks

## Projects

### 01 - Process Simulation Build
Creating a realistic industrial process simulation (tank level control, pump operations) using OpenPLC and ScadaBR.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 02 - Replay Attack Case Study
Executing Modbus replay attack, detecting through timing and source analysis, and documenting full incident lifecycle.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 03 - Sensor Spoofing Analysis
Injecting false sensor readings, analyzing safety impacts, and building anomaly detection for out-of-range values.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 04 - Unauthorized PLC Write
Simulating unauthorized control commands, implementing multi-layer detection, and creating SOC response playbook.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 05 - Comprehensive ICS Incident Report
Full professional incident report demonstrating complete attack chain, detection methodology, and remediation strategy.

**Status:** Coming soon

## Tools Used

- **Attack Tools:** Python scripts, Modbus manipulation tools
- **Detection:** Splunk SIEM, Suricata IDS, custom correlation rules
- **Analysis:** Wireshark, packet capture analysis
- **Documentation:** Professional incident report templates

## Key Deliverables

- Multiple attack-to-detection case studies
- ICS-specific SOC playbooks
- Professional incident response documentation
- MITRE ATT&CK for ICS mapping
- Executive, operations, and technical briefings

## ICS Attack Techniques Covered

- **Replay Attacks:** Capturing and replaying legitimate commands
- **Sensor Spoofing:** Injecting false process values
- **Unauthorized Writes:** Manipulating PLC logic or outputs
- **Network Reconnaissance:** ICS-specific discovery techniques

## Timeline

Estimated completion: Weeks 13-20 of the 30-week program.
