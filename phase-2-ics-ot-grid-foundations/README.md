# Phase 2: ICS/OT & Grid Foundations

**Duration:** Weeks 7-12  
**Focus:** Understanding operational technology, industrial control systems, and electric grid architecture

## Phase Objectives

This phase bridges IT security knowledge with the unique challenges of operational technology (OT) and introduces electric grid architecture fundamentals. The goal is to understand what makes OT security different and how the electric grid operates before specializing in WAMPAC security.

## Skills Developed

- ICS/OT security fundamentals
- IT vs OT differences and implications
- Electric grid architecture and operations
- SCADA system security
- Industrial protocol analysis (Modbus, DNP3)
- Purdue Model network segmentation
- Substation automation basics
- Safety-critical system considerations

## Projects & Labs

### Week 7-8: OT Fundamentals & Architecture
- IT vs OT comparison and security implications
- Purdue Model implementation
- OpenPLC and SCADA lab deployment
- Network segmentation for safety systems
- OT baseline and anomaly detection

### Week 9-10: Industrial Protocols & SCADA
- Modbus protocol analysis with Wireshark
- DNP3 protocol fundamentals
- SCADA system architecture and components
- PLC programming basics (ladder logic)
- Protocol security considerations

### Week 11-12: Electric Grid & Substation Automation
- Power grid architecture (generation → transmission → distribution)
- Substation components and operations
- IEC 61850 introduction
- Grid monitoring and control systems
- Safety and reliability requirements

## Key Concepts

- **Purdue Model:** Network segmentation framework for ICS/OT
- **Safety vs Security:** Balancing cybersecurity with operational safety
- **Real-Time Requirements:** Why patching and updates differ in OT
- **Legacy Systems:** Understanding decades-old infrastructure
- **Air-Gapping Myths:** Why isolation isn't always practical

## Tools & Technologies

- **ICS/SCADA:** OpenPLC, ScadaBR
- **Protocol Analysis:** Wireshark, tcpdump
- **Simulation:** Grid and substation simulators
- **Documentation:** Technical diagrams and architecture documentation

## Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, you'll understand:
- Fundamental differences between IT and OT security
- How electric grids are structured and operated
- Industrial communication protocols
- Network segmentation for critical systems
- Why OT security requires specialized knowledge
