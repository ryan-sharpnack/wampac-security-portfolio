# Phase 1: Purple Team Foundation

## Overview

This phase focuses on building core offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills through hands-on lab work. The goal is to develop a purple team mindset where offensive understanding directly improves defensive capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand attack methodologies and execution
- Build detection logic based on offensive techniques
- Implement SIEM monitoring and alerting
- Map activities to MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Document full attack-to-detection workflows

## Projects

### 01 - Lab Infrastructure Setup
Setting up the foundational lab environment with multiple VMs, network segmentation, and monitoring tools.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 02 - Credential Attack Detection
Executing password spraying attacks and building Splunk detection rules to identify credential-based attacks.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 03 - Lateral Movement Analysis
Simulating lateral movement techniques and implementing network-based detection using Suricata IDS.

**Status:** Coming soon

### 04 - Data Exfiltration Detection
Testing DNS tunneling and other exfiltration methods with behavioral detection logic.

**Status:** Coming soon
