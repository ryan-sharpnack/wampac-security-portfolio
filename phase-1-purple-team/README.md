# Phase 1: Purple Team Foundation

**Duration:** Weeks 1-6  
**Focus:** Building offensive and defensive security capabilities with IT security fundamentals

## Phase Objectives

This phase establishes the foundation for Purple Team operations by developing skills in both offensive security (red team) and defensive security (blue team). The goal is to understand how attacks work in order to build effective detection and response capabilities.

## Skills Developed

- Offensive security fundamentals
- Attack simulation and execution
- Detection engineering
- SIEM implementation and rule development
- Log analysis and correlation
- Incident response basics
- MITRE ATT&CK framework application

## Projects & Labs

### Week 1-2: Lab Setup & Credential Attacks
- Lab infrastructure deployment
- Windows/Linux target environment configuration
- Password spraying and credential attack simulation
- Splunk detection rule development
- Attack → Detection → Communication workflow

### Week 3-4: Lateral Movement & Persistence
- Network reconnaissance and enumeration
- Lateral movement techniques (PsExec, RDP, WMI)
- Persistence mechanism deployment
- Network-based detection with Suricata
- Multi-layer detection strategy

### Week 5-6: Data Exfiltration & Documentation
- Data staging and exfiltration techniques
- Protocol analysis and anomaly detection
- Full attack chain simulation
- Comprehensive case study documentation
- Executive and technical reporting

## Learning Logs

Weekly learning logs document progress, challenges, and lessons learned:
- [Week 1 Learning Log](learning-logs/week-01-learning-log.md)

## Tools & Technologies

- **Attack Platform:** Kali Linux
- **Target Systems:** Windows 10, Ubuntu Server
- **SIEM:** Splunk Enterprise
- **IDS/IPS:** Suricata
- **Network Analysis:** Wireshark, tcpdump
- **Scripting:** Python, PowerShell, Bash

## Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, you'll see demonstrated capability in:
- Executing multi-stage cyber attacks
- Building detection rules for offensive techniques
- Correlating events across multiple data sources
- Communicating security findings to different audiences
- Applying Purple Team methodology to security operations
