# About Me

## Background

After working in IT Support, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity—particularly the unique challenges of protecting critical infrastructure and industrial control systems. The intersection of offensive security, detection engineering, and operational technology fascinates me, especially when applied to the specialized domain of Wide-Area Monitoring, Protection, and Control (WAMPAC) systems.

I'm drawn to electric grid security because of its critical importance to society and the sophisticated threat landscape it faces from nation-state actors targeting transmission infrastructure. The challenge of securing synchrophasor systems where a vulnerability can have cascading effects on grid stability drives my commitment to this specialization.

## Professional Experience

**IT Support**
- Provided technical support across multiple environments
- Managed hardware lifecycle, asset inventory, and vendor coordination
- Developed systematic troubleshooting methodologies and technical documentation practices
- Built foundation in networking, Windows/Linux systems, and enterprise IT operations
- Established operational discipline and cross-functional collaboration skills

**Current Focus: WAMPAC Security Specialization**
- Specializing in Wide-Area Monitoring, Protection, and Control (WAMPAC) security
- Deep focus on synchrophasor protocol security (IEEE C37.118)
- Building expertise in PMU/PDC security and threat modeling
- Purple Team methodology for electric grid infrastructure
- NERC-CIP compliance for transmission operations

## Why This Portfolio?

This portfolio represents a structured, intensive 40-week self-study program designed to build professional-level expertise in:

- WAMPAC security and synchrophasor protocol analysis
- PMU/PDC security architecture and threat modeling
- Purple Team operations (offensive and defensive security)
- Electric grid cybersecurity and transmission operations
- ICS/OT security fundamentals (SCADA, network segmentation, industrial protocols)
- Detection engineering and incident response for grid infrastructure

Rather than just collecting certifications, I wanted to demonstrate hands-on capability through documented labs, protocol analysis, attack simulations, detection engineering, and professional-grade deliverables that mirror real-world WAMPAC security work.

## Career Goals

Seeking roles in:
- WAMPAC Security Engineering
- Synchrophasor Protocol Security
- Electric Grid Cybersecurity
- Purple Team Operations (ICS/OT focus)
- Transmission & Grid Operations Security
- Critical Infrastructure Protection

## Technical Foundation

**IT Support Experience:**
- System administration (Windows Server, Linux)
- Network troubleshooting and infrastructure support
- Asset management and hardware lifecycle
- Technical documentation and vendor coordination
- Process standardization and operational excellence

**Current WAMPAC Security Study Focus:**
- WAMPAC architecture and synchrophasor systems
- IEEE C37.118 protocol analysis and security
- PMU/PDC security implementation and threat modeling
- Purple Team methodology (offensive and defensive operations)
- Detection engineering with SIEM platforms (Splunk)
- Electric grid threat intelligence and NERC-CIP compliance
- Network security architecture and protocol analysis
- ICS/OT security fundamentals and Purdue Model
- Incident response and security documentation

## Learning Approach

My learning philosophy emphasizes:

- **Hands-on practice** over theoretical knowledge alone
- **Purple Team thinking** (understanding attacks to build better defenses)
- **Protocol-level analysis** (deep technical understanding of synchrophasor communications)
- **Real-world relevance** (focusing on actual transmission operator challenges)
- **Professional documentation** (communicating to technical and non-technical audiences)
- **Safety mindset** (understanding grid reliability and operational constraints)
- **Specialization depth** (becoming an expert in WAMPAC rather than generalist in ICS/OT)

## Lab Environment

I've built a comprehensive home lab using:

- Dell OptiPlex 3040 (i5, 16GB RAM) running Ubuntu with VirtualBox
- Multiple VMs (Kali Linux, Windows 10, Ubuntu Server, PMU/PDC simulators)
- Raspberry Pi 5 for dedicated monitoring/SIEM
- Network segmentation simulating IT/OT/WAMPAC architecture
- Protocol analysis tools (Wireshark, tcpdump, custom Python scripts)
- Free and open-source tools throughout

## Personal Interests

Beyond cybersecurity, I'm interested in:

- Electric grid modernization and smart grid technologies
- Synchrophasor applications and wide-area situational awareness
- WAMPAC system architecture and grid stability
- Nation-state cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure
- Transmission operations and substation automation
- The intersection of grid reliability and cybersecurity

## Contact & Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with professionals in the WAMPAC security, electric grid cybersecurity, and energy sector communities.
