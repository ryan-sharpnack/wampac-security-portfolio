# About Me

## Background

After working in IT Support, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity—particularly the unique challenges of protecting critical infrastructure and industrial control systems. The intersection of offensive security, detection engineering, and operational technology fascinates me because it requires both technical depth and an understanding of real-world safety and reliability concerns.

I'm drawn to the energy sector because of its critical importance to society and the sophisticated threat landscape it faces from nation-state actors and ransomware groups. The challenge of securing systems where a vulnerability can have real-world safety consequences drives my commitment to this specialization.

## Professional Experience

**IT Support**
- Provided technical support across multiple environments
- Managed hardware and vendor coordination
- Developed troubleshooting expertise and customer service skills
- Built foundation in networking, Windows/Linux systems, and enterprise IT operations

**Current Focus: Cybersecurity Specialization**
- Transitioning from IT Support to offensive and defensive security operations
- Building hands-on expertise through intensive lab-based learning
- Specializing in Purple Team methodology and ICS/OT security
- Focusing on energy sector and critical infrastructure protection

## Why This Portfolio?

This portfolio represents a structured, intensive 30-week self-study program designed to build professional-level skills in:
- **Purple Team operations** (offensive and defensive security)
- **ICS/OT cybersecurity** (SCADA, PLC, industrial protocols)
- **Energy sector specialization** (NERC-CIP, grid security, threat intelligence)

Rather than just collecting certifications, I wanted to demonstrate hands-on capability through documented labs, attack simulations, detection engineering, and professional-grade deliverables that mirror real-world security work.

## Career Goals

Seeking roles in:
- ICS/OT Cybersecurity Analysis
- Purple Team Operations
- SOC Analysis (OT focus)
- Energy Sector Security
- Critical Infrastructure Protection

## Technical Foundation

**IT Support Experience:**
- System administration (Windows Server, Linux)
- Network troubleshooting and infrastructure support
- Hardware management
- Technical documentation and vendor coordination

**Current Cybersecurity Study Focus:**
- Offensive security and penetration testing methodologies
- Detection engineering with SIEM platforms (Splunk)
- ICS/OT security and industrial protocol analysis
- Energy sector threat intelligence and compliance (NERC-CIP)
- Network segmentation and Purdue Model architecture
- Incident response and security documentation

## Learning Approach

My learning philosophy emphasizes:
- **Hands-on practice** over theoretical knowledge alone
- **Purple team thinking** (understanding attacks to build better defenses)
- **Real-world relevance** (focusing on actual industry challenges)
- **Professional documentation** (communicating to technical and non-technical audiences)
- **Safety mindset** (understanding operational constraints in OT environments)

## Lab Environment

I've built a comprehensive home lab using:
- Dell OptiPlex 3040 (i5, 16GB RAM) running Ubuntu with VirtualBox
- Multiple VMs (Kali Linux, Windows 10, Ubuntu Server, OpenPLC/SCADA)
- Raspberry Pi 5 for dedicated monitoring/SIEM
- Network segmentation simulating IT/OT separation
- Free and open-source tools throughout

## Personal Interests

Beyond cybersecurity, I'm interested in:
- Critical infrastructure resilience
- Industrial automation and control systems
- Energy grid modernization challenges
- Nation-state cyber operations and threat intelligence
- The intersection of physical safety and cybersecurity

## Contact & Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with professionals in the ICS/OT security and energy sector cybersecurity communities.
