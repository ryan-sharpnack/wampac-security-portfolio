# Phase 4: Advanced Detection & Response

**Duration:** Weeks 21-28  
**Focus:** Building detection and incident response capabilities for WAMPAC environments

## Phase Objectives

This phase focuses on developing advanced detection engineering skills specifically for WAMPAC systems. The goal is to build multi-layer detection strategies, protocol-based threat detection, and incident response playbooks for synchrophasor environments.

## Skills Developed

- WAMPAC attack scenario simulation
- Protocol-based anomaly detection
- Multi-layer detection architecture
- SIEM correlation for synchrophasor systems
- Behavioral analysis for WAMPAC data
- Incident response for grid operations
- SOC playbook development
- Threat hunting in OT environments

## Projects & Labs

### Week 21-22: WAMPAC Attack Scenarios
- Data injection attack simulation
- Replay attack execution and detection
- Sensor spoofing scenarios
- Time synchronization attacks
- Man-in-the-middle on synchrophasor communications
- GPS spoofing and impact analysis

### Week 23-24: Protocol-Based Detection
- IEEE C37.118 anomaly detection
- Statistical analysis of synchrophasor data
- Baseline establishment for normal operations
- Protocol violation detection
- Frame sequence analysis
- Data quality indicator monitoring

### Week 25-26: SIEM Correlation & Analysis
- Splunk data ingestion for synchrophasor systems
- Custom parsing for IEEE C37.118
- Correlation rules for WAMPAC events
- Dashboard creation for grid operations
- Alert tuning and false positive reduction
- Integration with network detection (Suricata)

### Week 27-28: Incident Response Playbooks
- WAMPAC-specific incident scenarios
- SOC analyst playbooks
- Escalation procedures for grid operations
- Communication templates for utility stakeholders
- Post-incident analysis framework
- Lessons learned documentation

## Key Concepts

- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple detection layers for WAMPAC
- **Protocol Awareness:** Understanding normal vs malicious behavior
- **Operational Context:** Why grid operations matter for detection
- **False Positive Management:** Balancing sensitivity with alert fatigue
- **Coordinated Response:** Working with grid operators and engineers

## Tools & Technologies

- **SIEM:** Splunk Enterprise with custom parsers
- **IDS/IPS:** Suricata with custom rules
- **Analysis:** Python for behavioral analysis
- **Visualization:** Grafana, Splunk dashboards
- **Documentation:** SOC playbook templates

## Outcomes

By the end of Phase 4, you'll have:
- Comprehensive WAMPAC attack scenario documentation
- Working detection rules for multiple attack types
- Functional SIEM correlation for synchrophasor data
- Professional SOC playbooks for WAMPAC incidents
- Demonstrated incident response capability
